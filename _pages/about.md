Hi, I am glad you are here!

I am currently a blockchain consultant at [Common Prefix](https://www.commonprefix.com/), where I do research, consulting, and engineering
on blockchains and applied cryptography.
Prior to that I briefly worked at [DFNS](https://www.dfns.co/), building on threshold ECDSA and threshold key management protocols,
and at [IBM Research Zurich](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/), building scalable large-scale consensus protocols.

I obtained my PhD at the [Crypto group](https://crypto.unibe.ch/) of the University of Bern,
where I had the privilege to be advised by Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/).
My PhD thesis was on [Distributed Protocols with Threshold and General Trust Assumptions](/files/papers/phd_thesis.pdf).
My research interests lie in the fields of distributed systems and applied cryptography, bridging theory and practice.

Before that I worked as a software engineer at [Entersoft](https://www.entersoft.eu/),
a leading company in the sector of financial technology (aka web2), where
I learned to appreciate qualitative code, good design patterns, and clean architecture.

I obtained my BSc and MSc in computer science from the school of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](//www.ece.ntua.gr/en)
at [National Technical University of Athens](//www.ntua.gr/en/).
My master thesis was on network security with deep learning methods at [Netmode Lab](http://www.netmode.ntua.gr/main/).

Concerning ~~hobbits~~hobbies, I enjoy dancing and I teach greek folk dances.
I regularly watch the Lord of the Rings (and the less regularly the first Hobbit film). I am also learning to play the violin.
On a more refreshing side, I sometimes brew tasty beers. Cheers!
