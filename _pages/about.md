Hi, welcome to my webpage.

I do research in distributed systems and applied cryptography.
Specifically, I have investigated the security and scalability of distributed systems and blockchains,
protocols for practical and efficient consensus,
as well as multiple threshold-cryptographic primitives, including digital signatures and randomness beacons.
My work is primarily systems-oriented and focused on the real world. 
However, I enjoy understanding theoretical concepts and augmenting the theory whenever necessary.

I obtained my PhD at the [University of Bern](https://crypto.unibe.ch/),
where I had the privilege to be advised by Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/).

During my PhD I completed two internships. The first was with [IBM Research](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/) in Zurich,
where I collaborated with [Marko Vukolić](https://vukolic.com/), now at Protocols Labs,
[Matej Pavlovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matej-pavlovic-4241224b/), now at Protocol Labs,
and [Chrysoula Stathakopoulou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrysoula-stathakopoulou-66842984/), now at Chainlink Labs.
We explored the scalability of consensus protocols in large, wide-area deployments, and coded in Golang.
The second internship was at [DFNS](https://www.dfns.co/), where I collaborated, among others,
with [Jonathan Katz](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/).
We worked on threshold ECDSA protocols and coded in Rust.

I enjoy collaborating with other researchers. During my PhD I collaborated with [Luca Zanolini](https://lucazanolini.com/), now at Ethereum Foundation, on topics including consensus protocols, general and asymmetric trust assumptions, and composition of distributed systems.
Moreover, with [Duc V. Le](https://levduc.github.io/), staff research scientist at Visa Research, we worked on polynomial commitments and digital signatures.
With Simon Holmgaard Kamp and [Jesper Buus Nielsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/jbn%40cs.au.dk),
affiliated with the Aarhus University and Concordium, we developed asynchronous consensus protocols for proof-of-stake blockchains.
With [Giorgia Azzurra Marson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgia-azzurra-marson-87017126/) from NEC Laboratories Europe we explored
foundational properties of smart contracts.

Moreover, in Bern I (co-)supervised 3 MSc and 9 BSc [student theses](https://crypto.unibe.ch/theses/)
on various topics related to cryptography and blockchains,
and had the pleasure to assist in three courses: Discrete mathematics (BSc, 20219), Cryptography (MSc, 2020), and Privacy and data security (MSc, 2021).

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for two years as a software engineer
in the sector of financial technology. Employed by [Entersoft](https://www.entersoft.eu/),
I learned to appreciate clean and qualitative code, design patterns, and clean architecture.

I obtained my BSc and MSc in computer science from the school of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](//www.ece.ntua.gr/en)
at [National Technical University of Athens](//www.ntua.gr/en/).
My specialization included computing systems, software, computer networks, and mathematics.
My master thesis was on network security with deep learning methods at [Netmode Lab](http://www.netmode.ntua.gr/main/).

Concerning ~~hobbits~~hobbies, I possess a skipper's license and in summer I delight in sailing the Mediterranean.
In winter I watch the Lord of the Rings, or learn to play the violin.
On a more refreshing side, I sometimes brew tasty beers. Cheers, and feel free to get in touch with me.
